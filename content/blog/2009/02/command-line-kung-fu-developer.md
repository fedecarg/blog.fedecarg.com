Want to become a Linux guru, or just look like one? Then visit [Command-Line-Fu](http://www.commandlinefu.com/).

From the site:

> Command-Line-Fu is the place to record those command-line gems that you return to again and again. Delete that bloated snippets file you've been using and share your personal repository with the world. That way others can gain from your CLI wisdom and you from theirs too. All commands can be commented on and discussed. Voting is also encouraged so the best float to the top.

You can subscribe to the feeds or [follow the latest commands](http://twitter.com/commandlinefu) on Twitter. Every new command is wrapped in a tweet and posted to the Command-Line-Fu account.
