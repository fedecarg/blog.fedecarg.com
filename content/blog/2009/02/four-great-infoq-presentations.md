Hope you like these recommendations and if you know of any other good tech-related video, then please let me know.

### 1\. Developing Expertise: Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep

One of my favourites. In this presentation Dave Thomas ([The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer)) talks about expanding people's expertise in their domains of interest by not treating them uniformly as they had the same amount of knowledge and level of experience.

### 2\. Real World Web Services

Another good presentation. In this one Scott Davis provides a pragmatic, down-to-earth introduction to Web services as used in the real world by public sites, including SOAP-based and REST examples.

### 3\. CouchDB and me

This presentation is different, and that's why I like it so much. Damien Katz shares his experiences and reminds people how difficult but at the same time gratifying is to be an open source developer. He talks about the history of CouchDB development from a very personal point of view. His inspirations for CouchDB and why he decided to move my wife and kids to a cheaper place and live off savings to build this thing.

### 4\. Yahoo! Communities Architectures

In this presentation, Ian Flint tries to explain the infrastructure and architecture employed by Yahoo! to keep going a multitude of servers running of different platforms and offering different services. Very interesting!
