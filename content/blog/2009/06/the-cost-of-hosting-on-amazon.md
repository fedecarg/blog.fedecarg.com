Mather Corgan, president of HotPads, gave a great talk on how HotPads uses AWS to run their real estate search engine. HotPads abandoned their managed hosting in December and took the leap over to EC2 and its siblings. The presentation has a lot of detail on costs and other things to watch out for, so if you're currently planning your "cloud" architecture, you'll find some of this really helpful.
