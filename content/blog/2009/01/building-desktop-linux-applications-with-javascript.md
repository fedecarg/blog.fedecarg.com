During his [keynote presentation](http://arstechnica.com/articles/paedia/shuttleworth-oscon-keynote.ars) at OSCON last year, Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth described application extensibility as an important enabler of innovation and user empowerment. Citing the Firefox web browser and its rich ecosystem of add-ons as an example, Shuttleworth suggested that the Linux community could deliver a lot of extra value by making scriptable automation and plugin capabilities available pervasively across the entire desktop stack.

Mark Shuttleworth also described his strategy for accelerating the adoption of Linux. He discussed the importance of extensibility in open platforms, contemplated the challenges of adapting conventional software methodologies so that they can be used for community-driven development, and contended that the open source software community has the potential to deliver a user experience which exceeds that of Apple's Mac OS X platform.
