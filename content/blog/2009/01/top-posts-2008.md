I looked through this blogâ€™s statistics to find out which posts got the most page views in 2008. Here are the top 10 posts:

9. [BBC's New Infrastructure: Java and PHP](http://kewnode.wordpress.com/2008/06/02/bbc-new-infrastructure-java-and-php/)
10. [Code Refactoring Guidelines](http://kewnode.wordpress.com/2008/09/14/code-refactoring-guidelines/)

Each post was written for a reason. "Open-source applications that changed the world" is my favourite one. It not only brings back good memories, but also shows our commitment to the open-source community and our passion for developing and supporting open-source software. Zend Framework was the most popular Web application in 2008. Yes, Dow Jones, HSBC and even the BBC is using it. In case you haven't notice, I spent the last 12 months promoting the Zend Framework, reason why it gets mentioned in 6 of the posts. I'm also glad that "Code Refactoring Guidelines" made it to the top 10. It shows that the PHP community [cares](http://www.icareaboutsoftware.org/).
