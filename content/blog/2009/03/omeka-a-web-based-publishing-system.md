The [Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/) has released an open source version of their Web-based publishing system built on top of the [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/).

[Omeka](http://omeka.org/) is a Web-based publishing platform for scholars, librarians, archivists, museum professionals, educators, and cultural enthusiasts. Its “five-minute setup” makes launching an online exhibition as easy as launching a blog. Omeka is designed with non-IT specialists in mind, allowing users to focus on content and interpretation rather than programming. It brings Web 2.0 technologies and approaches to academic and cultural websites to foster user interaction and participation. It makes top-shelf design easy with a simple and flexible templating system. Its robust open-source developer and user communities underwrite Omeka’s stability and sustainability.

Thank you guys for open sourcing this great application!
