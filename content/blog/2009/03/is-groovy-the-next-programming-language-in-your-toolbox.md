Groovy offers the flexibility of PHP and the power and capabilities of Java. Groovy meets all the requirements: optional static typing, familiar syntax, runs on a VM, performs as well as Java and supports lots of hot buzzwords like closures and builders. If you are a PHP and/or Ruby developer, I'm sure you are going to love Groovy.

If you are interested in learning more about Groovy and Grails and what it has to offer to your developer toolbox, keep an eye on my blog for some groovy posts :)
