Ten things no one ever told you about [Hudson](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Meet+Hudson):

1. It's extremely easy to install (unzip the file and that's it)
2. It can be configured entirely from its friendly Web UI (no XML required)
3. It has an attractive dashboard with colourful and meaningful icons
4. It's extremely flexible
5. It can be extended via plug-ins
6. It offers a much better UI than CruiseControl
7. It can execute Phing, Ant, Gant, NAnt and Maven build scripts
8. It gives you clean readable URLs for most of its pages
9. It has RSS, e-mail and IM integration
10. It can distribute build/test loads to multiple computers

[This tutorial](http://plainead.googlecode.com/svn/!svn/bc/6/trunk/articles/) guides you step-by-step through the fundamental concepts of Continuous Integration and Hudson. When you are done with this one-hour tutorial, you will understand the benefits of Continuous Integration as well as how to set up your environment.
