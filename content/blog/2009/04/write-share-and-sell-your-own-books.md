As commercial book publishing crashes, personal book publishing is booming. [Blurb](http://www.blurb.com/) is an online application which can be used to design and print your books in professional looking formats. Blurb makes it easier for you to write, share, promote and sell your own books.

Blurb [BookSmart software](http://www.blurb.com/learn_more/booksmart) is the most straightforward and easy to use software available. Multiple [demos](http://www.blurb.com/help/video/booksmart) and tutorials are available, showcasing the potential that each Blurb book offers. Some of the books you buy on Amazon are manufactured with this same technology. You just can't tell the difference!

From their site:

> Holding a finished book with your name on the cover is a truly amazing feeling; it’s one of those experiences everyone should have. As software people, designers and publishing professionals at the top of our game, we realized something both incredible and obvious: there’s no good reason why it should take tons of time, technical skills, big bucks or friends in high places to publish a book. Or a zillion books, for that matter.

### Blurb Features

- Print your book by ordering online (as few as 1 book needs ordering)
