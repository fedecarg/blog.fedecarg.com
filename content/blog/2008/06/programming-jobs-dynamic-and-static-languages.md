I've built large systems in dynamic and static languages. Neither is necessarily better or worse than the other in terms of maintainability, if you know what you are doing. [Ted Neward](http://blogs.tedneward.com/) said that at the end of the day, the whole static vs dynamic thing doesn't matter. One should simply chose the languages that can:

1\. Provide the ability to express the concept in your head, and 2. Provide the ability to evolve as the concepts in your head evolve
