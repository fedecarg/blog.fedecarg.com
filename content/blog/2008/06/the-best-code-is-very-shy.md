The best code is very shy. Like a four-year old hiding behind a mothers skirt, code should not reveal too much of itself and should not be too nosy into others affairs. But you might find that your shy code grows up too fast, shedding its demure shyness in favor of wild promiscuity. When code isn't shy, you'll get unwanted coupling.
