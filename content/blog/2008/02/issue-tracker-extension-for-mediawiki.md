MediaWiki is definitely one of the most widely used and best known Wikis out there, it powers Wikipedia.com, but I'm sure you already knew that. I've been using it at work to record and document all our internal systems and projects. It's a great tool, it allows developers and projects managers to collaborate, provide and share information in a very simple and organized way.

In the last couple of months, Iâ€™ve been developing some extensions for MediaWiki, the latest one is called [Issue Tracker](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:IssueTracker). Watch the following screencast to know more about this extension:
