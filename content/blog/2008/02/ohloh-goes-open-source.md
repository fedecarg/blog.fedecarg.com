The first piece of technology to be released is Ohcount, the source code line counter that powers the Ohloh reporting engine. Ohcount is available for immediate download from [Ohloh Labs](http://labs.ohloh.net/ohcount), the new developer website dedicated to the Ohloh source code. They plan to release additional tools over the coming months, ultimately releasing all of the Ohloh technology to the open source community.Get the [Ohcount source code](http://labs.ohloh.net/ohcount).
