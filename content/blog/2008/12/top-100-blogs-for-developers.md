PHPImpact makes it to the top 100!

What defines the popularity of a blog? The ranking by Google? Traffic statistics? Feed subscriptions? Feedback from readers? Links from other sites and blogs? The answer is of course... All of them!

Jurgen Appelo announced the new edition of the [Top 100 Blogs for Developers](http://www.noop.nl/2008/12/top-100-blogs-for-developers-q4-2008.html). The list is based on a weighed average of each blog's Google PageRank, Alexa Rank, Technorati Authority, RSSMicro FeedRank, Google hits, and blog comments.
