Netbooks will account for about a third of all PC growth this year, according to Citigroup. They are a real threat to Microsoft. Clearly, the future is in netbooks and that has Microsoft worried. Microsoft isn't just worried about ceding 30% of the netbook market to Linux, it's also worried that if people get used to running Linux on netbooks, they'll consider buying Linux on desktop PCs as well.

According to Dickie Chang, this gives users a chance to see and try something new, showing them **there is an alternative**.

Happy New Year!
