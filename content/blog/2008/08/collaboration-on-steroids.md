[Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/), the world's most widely used enterprise wiki, announced expanded integration with Microsoft Office and [SharePoint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint) that introduces Confluence to the masses. The latest release includes a host of goodies for business users looking to flex their productivity muscles and improve collaboration.

Confluence 2.9 includes a new alternative that makes editing a wiki page much simpler for everyone. Confluence users can now edit wiki pages directly from Microsoft Excel, Word or PowerPoint, via an exclusive new plugin called Office Connector.
