Regardless of the development process that you use, a description of the software architecture can be essential for any project, big or small. If software architecture is about the structure of a system and is the vehicle for satisfying the requirements, then the software architecture document is a written description of this.

The Software Architecture Document Guidelines v0.1 includes:

1. An outline description of the software architecture, including major software components and their interactions.
2. A common understanding of the architectural principles used during design and implementation.
3. A description of the hardware and software platforms on which the system is built and deployed.
4. Explicit justification of how the architecture meets the non-functional requirements.
