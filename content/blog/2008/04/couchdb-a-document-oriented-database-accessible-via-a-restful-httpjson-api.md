[CouchDB](http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/index.html) was accepted for incubation at the Apache Software Foundation a couple of months ago. My congrats to the development team! It's a very interesting and challenging project, and the fact that it was accepted for incubation will definitely get the team exited.

**What is CouchDB?**

- A document database server, accessible via a RESTful JSON API.
- Ad-hoc and schema-free with a flat address space.
- Distributed, featuring robust, incremental replication with bi-directional conflict detection and management.
- Query-able and index-able, featuring a table oriented reporting engine that uses Javascript as a query language.
