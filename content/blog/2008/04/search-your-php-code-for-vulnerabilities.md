I'm a big fan of [PHP\_CodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer) and I think it's a great development tool, it ensures that you write code that is easy to read and maintain. But, what about making sure that the code you write is secure and doesn't have any vulnerabilities?

**Right, there's another tool for that...**

[PHP Security Scanner](http://securityscanner.lostfiles.de/index.php) is a tool written in PHP intended to search PHP code for vulnerabilities. MySQL DB stores patterns to search for as well as the results from the search. The tool can scan any directory on the file system.
