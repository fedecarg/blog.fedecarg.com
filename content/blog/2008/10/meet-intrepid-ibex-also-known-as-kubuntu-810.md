Intrepid Ibex is the codename for Kubuntu 8.10, due to be released October 30 2008.

The focus for 8.10 for the Kubuntu community will be transitioning to a KDE 4 desktop. The plan is to integrate the existing Kubuntu software while at the same time offering the best out-of-the-box KDE 4 experience around. Intrepid Ibex is a whole new revolution for the open-source community, Intrepidly going where no Kubuntu release has gone before.

The key improvements in Kubuntu 8.10 are:

- The KDE-PIM suite is back
- Plasma matures
- Many new and improved applications and frameworks

### KWin

KWin's desktopgrid visualizes the concept of virtual desktops and makes it easier to remember where you left that window you're looking for.

### Plasma

The new folderview applet lets you display the content of arbitrary directories on your desktop. Drop a directory onto your unlocked desktop to create a new folderview. A folderview can not only display local directories, but can also cope with locations on the network.
