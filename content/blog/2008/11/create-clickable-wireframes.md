![protoshare_small](http://kewnode.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/protoshare_small.png "protoshare_small")I found an interesting web-hosted application called [ProtoShare](http://www.protoshare.com/) that allows you to create clickable and working wireframes very easily. It has all the HTML elements you would need to design a web application, like headers, text areas, form interaction and even drop-down XHTML menus. Once you have a design, you can share it with others. It also creates a basic, linkable template that allows you to preview usage flow and overall experience.

This [screencast](http://site9.s3.amazonaws.com/protoshare/tour/Protoshare.html) demonstrates how ProtoShare can be used to create wireframes.
