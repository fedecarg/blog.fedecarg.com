It is far easier to kill an idea than to encourage it and turn it into a useful solution. Be on a constant watchout for putting down an idea too early without understanding the positive reasons for it being suggested. Hopefully you will see that there are many ways in which you can be constructive.

To kill an idea, say:

- It's not part of your job
- That's not what we do here
- Costs too much
- Against the company policy
- It's not budgeted, maybe next year
- Let the other department handle that
- It is not our problem
- Why would you do something like that?
- We have been doing it another way for a long time and it works fine
- If it's so good, why hasn't someone suggested it already?
- Has anyone else tried it successfully?
- We have tried that before and it didn't work
- Is anyone crazy enough to try that?
- We're already doing that

To help an idea, say:

- Yes, and...
- Great, let's try it
- How can we make time to see if it will work?
- What resources would we need to do it? Tell me more
- How can we make it work?
- What are the advantages?
- How can we remove the dis-advantages?
- What can I do to help this happen?
- I like it
- That sounds interesting, tell me more
- How can we convince everyone else?
