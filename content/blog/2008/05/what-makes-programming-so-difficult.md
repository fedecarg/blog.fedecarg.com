In my opinion Software Developers are artists and the source code they produce is the final representation of their ideas. Programming is 95% design and a well designed software should be considered a masterpiece. But, non-programmers don't see it this way, most of them don't consider our profession to be creative.

Why is our job so different from other professions? **Karsten Wagner** wrote an [excellent article](http://kawagner.blogspot.com/2008/05/whats-makes-programming-so-difficult.html) about it.
