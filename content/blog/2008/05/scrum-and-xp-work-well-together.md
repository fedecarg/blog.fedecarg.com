A programmer cannot be Agile if the person that manages him is not Agile as well, and vice versa. That's why Scrum focuses on management and organization practices while XP focuses mostly on actual programming practices, and that's why they work so well together.

[This excellent free book](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/scrum-xp-from-the-trenches) aims to give you a head start by providing a detailed down-to-earth account of how one Swedish company implemented Scrum and XP with a team of approximately 40 people and how they continuously improved their process over a year's time.
