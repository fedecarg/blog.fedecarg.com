[This article](http://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-version-control) describes an example of how to handle version control in an agile environment with multiple teams. It's not primarily targeted for version control experts, in fact such experts probably won't find anything new here. It's aimed at the rest of us, those of us that just want to learn simple and useful ways to collaborate. It may be of interest to anyone directly involved in agile software development, regardless of role, branching and merging is everybody's business, not just the configuration manager.
