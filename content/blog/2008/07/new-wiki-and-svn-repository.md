Well, whether you have or haven't been [keeping up](http://kewnode.wordpress.com/2008/06/22/database-deployment-using-phing/) with my personal blog, I have created a Wiki to document some of the projects that I'm currently working on. For example, the [shell scripts](http://svn.fedecarg.com/browser/Shell%20Scripts/sync) that I have ported from Bash to PHP as [Phing Tasks](http://svn.fedecarg.com/browser/Phing/tasks/ext). I need to set aside a couple of days to start documenting the classes, and I will probably do that sometime soon.
