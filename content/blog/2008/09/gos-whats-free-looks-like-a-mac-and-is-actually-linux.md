The answer is [gOS](http://www.thinkgos.com/), a lightweight, web-heavy operating system that anyone can use.

The emphasis in gOS is on web apps and everyday tasks like browsing the web and checking e-mail. Under the hood, gOS is based on the solid Linux distribution base of Ubuntu 8.04.1, but aside from that familiar startup sound, you're unlikely to notice the Ubuntu underpinnings.

gOS instantly launches Google Gadgets for Linux on startup, introducing over 100,000 possible iGoogle and Google Gadgets to the desktop. Google Documents, Calendar, and Mail launch in Mozilla Prism windows to closer resemble desktop applications. The newest release of WINE 1.0 is included to now support thousands of Windows software.
