**SoapUI** is a free and open source desktop application for inspecting, invoking, developing, simulating/mocking and functional/load/compliance testing of web services over HTTP. It is mainly aimed at developers providing and/or consuming web services. Functional and Load-Testing can be done both interactively in soapUI or within an automated build/integration process using the soapUI command-line tools. Mock Web Services can easily be created for any WSDL and hosted from within soapUI or using the command-line MockService runner. IDE-plugins are available for eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans and a specialized eclipse-plugin for JBossWS.

**Web Service Inspection**

The following features for inspecting web services are currently available:

- Imported WSDL:s are shown as a hierarchy view of interfaces (PortTypes) and their operations
- Support for both SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2
- WSDL Viewer allows easy navigation of WSDL and included/imported WSDLs/XSDs
- HTTP wire log shows actual requests sent and received
- View SSL Certificate information for secure responses
- XML Schema Inspector (soapUI Pro only)
- Table Inspector for easily viewing tabular data (soapUI Pro only)
- Form Editor for easy understanding of message input (soapUI Pro only)
