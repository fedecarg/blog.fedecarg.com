For 50 years, computer programmers have been writing code. New technologies continue to emerge, develop, and mature at a rapid pace. Now there are more than 2,500 documented programming languages! O'Reilly has produced a poster called [History of Programming Languages](http://www.oreilly.com/news/graphics/prog_lang_poster.pdf) (PDF: 701K), which plots over 50 programming languages on a multi-layered, color-coded timeline.[](http://www.oreilly.com/news/graphics/prog_lang_poster.pdf "history-poster20.jpg")
