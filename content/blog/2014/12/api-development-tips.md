Organisations who are paying attention already know they need to have an open web API, and many already have under development or in the wild. Make sure you havenâ€™t been caught by the pitfalls of many early API releases.

### Multiple points of failure

- Back-end systems: db servers/caches, hardware failures, etc.
- Interconnections: router failures, bad cables, etc.
- External Dependencies: fail whales, random cloud latency, etc.

### The 5 tips

1. **Test it all**
    - Unit test are not enough, they are just the beginning.
    - Test what users experience. Perform end-to-end black box tests.
    - Replay your access logs. Very accurate.
    - Validate return payloads. A stack trace is not valid XML.
2. **Plan for future versions**
    - Versions are not sexy/semantic (but do it anyway).
    - Announce versions often.
3. **Embrace standards**
    - APIs are better when predictable.
    - Standard approaches mean tools.
    - Avoid uncomfortable migrations. No one wants an OAuthpocalypse.
4. **Monitor everything & be honest**
    - Trends are your friend.
    - Users are not your early-warning ops team.
    - Be open and honest, or your users will tweet that your API sucks!
5. **Fail well**
    - Well-formed errors win friends and makes users more tolerant to failure.
    - Make monitoring easy.
    - Don't punish everyone. Determine who gets hurt most by failures.
